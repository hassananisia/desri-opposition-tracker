However, it has encountered opposition due to its size and proximity to the Minidoka National Historic Site where 13,000 Japanese Americans were imprisoned during the 1940s. In May 2022, the National Trust for Historic Preservation named the Minidoka National Historic Site as one of the eleven most endangered historic places in the country due to the proposed wind farm, which would be visible from the visitor center. In July and August 2022, all three counties in which the project would be located passed resolutions against it. On January 20, 2023, BLM released a draft environmental impact statement in which BLM stated that its two preferred alternatives would consist of a reduced number of turbines (269 or 378 turbines rather than the 400 turbines the developer is seeking to construct), due to concerns raised in the review process. In March 2023, the Idaho House and Idaho Senate each adopted unanimous resolutions opposing the project. In April 2023, the commissioners of the following Idaho counties signed a joint resolution against the project: Cassia, Gooding, Jerome, Lincoln, Minidoka, Washington, and Twin Falls. In August 2023, BLM announced that the lands for the proposed project would be kept open for two more years to allow BLM time to determine if it will authorize the project. In October 2023, an Idaho Congressman introduced a bill to prevent the Secretary of Interior from approving a wind or solar project over state legislative disapproval, which would have the effect of blocking the Lava Ridge project. In December 2024, the Bureau of Land Management issued a record of decision approving the project.

Following a prior announcement to close the coal plant in 2020 and develop wind farms to replace the generation, the McLean County government opposed the move and placed a moratorium on new wind farms. In response to the 2022 sale of Coal Creek Station, McLean County leaders have indicated that they would be willing to lift the wind energy moratorium, as long as any development takes place alongside a plan to keep Coal Creek open. McLean County subsequently dropped the restrictions. In April 2024, however, McLean County Commissioners voted unanimously to deny a preliminary project area permit for the proposed Coal Creek Wind Farm.

Local governments twice denied necessary approvals for the onshore components of the project, prompting the state Board of Public Utilities to use its new authority to bypass local approvals—first in September 2022 when it bypassed Ocean City approvals and second in February 2023 when it bypassed Cape May County approvals. Various citizens groups opposed to offshore wind filed lawsuits against the developer Ørsted and the State of New Jersey, challenging the tax subsidies offered to the project and the state’s determination that the project is consistent with state coastal management laws. In July 2023, Ocean City Mayor Jay Gillian and his administration installed anti-wind farm signs at beach entrances located 15 miles from the offshore wind project. In August 2023, a state Superior Court granted a land easement to allow the Ocean Wind 1 project to bring underground power cables onshore in Ocean City, after Ocean City had refused to issue easements on the land near the project. In October 2023, Cape May County and several environmental, fishing, and hospitality organizations filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of the Interior and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, seeking to reverse approval of the project. The lawsuit included claims under the APA, NEPA, ESA, MMPA, NHPA, OCSLA, CWA, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Coastal Zone Management Act, and the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. Later in October 2023, Ørsted announced that it was ceasing development on Ocean Wind 1, along with a separate project—Ocean Wind 2—citing high inflation, rising interest rates, and supply chain bottlenecks.

The lawsuit alleged that these projects would disrupt endangered whale populations and that the cumulative impacts of noise pollution were not properly assessed. In February 2024, the court dismissed Save Long Beach Island’s lawsuit without prejudice for lack of standing and because the claims were unripe.

The project has garnered local opposition from groups such as Save Our Ridges, which maintains a website tracking the project. Construction was supposed to be finished by 2022, but the project was still under review as of August 2023. In August 2023, a hearing was scheduled for public comment about the proposed project. In September 2023, the Board of Benton County Commissioners published a resolution formally opposing the project. Opponents of the project have raised concerns about impacts to ferruginous hawks, as well as concerns about the cultural and historical significance of the Horse Heaven Hills to the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation. The community group Tri-Cities C.A.R.E.S (Community Action for Responsible Environmental Stewardship) has also argued that the project will reduce property values and could obstruct emergency planes or hospitals in the event of wildfires. The state Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council (EFSEC) voted in April 2024 to recommend the Horse Heaven Project for approval over objections from the Yakama Nation. The EFSEC’s recommendation halved the Horse Heaven project’s size due to concerns that the facility would impact local endangered hawk populations. In May 2024, however, Governor Inslee rejected the proposal to halve the size of the project. In September 2024, the EFSEC approved a version of the project with mitigation measures that did not involve reducing the size of the project.

The project faced immediate opposition from local residents, a conservation organization called Friends of the Columbia Gorge (“Friends”), and tourism groups, who raised concerns about poor project design and harm to scenic and wildlife resources. Over 400 public comments were submitted to the Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council (EFSEC), largely by opponents. In 2012, the Washington Department of Natural Resources denied the original project proposals but ultimately authorized a 10-year permit from 2012 to 2022 for up to 35 wind turbines. The Governor accepted the EFSEC’s recommendation and approved the project. In 2013, Friends challenged the approval in state court, which rejected their claims and affirmed the approval. In 2018, Friends filed a challenge in federal court, which also failed. However, the project was on hold until 2023, one year after the permit had expired. Whistling Ridge’s corporate successor, Twin Creeks Timber LLC filed a request to transfer ownership and extend the permit to 2026.

The transmission line is expected to support the interconnection of renewable energy generation in the upper Midwest region. The project has faced significant opposition. In 2021, the National Wildlife Refuge Association, the Driftless Area Land Conservancy, the Wisconsin Wildlife Federation, and the Defenders of Wildlife filed a series of lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin. The lawsuits, which were consolidated, challenged the project under NEPA, the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act. In November 2021, the federal district court granted a preliminary injunction preventing development of the project that would impact wetlands in southern Wisconsin’s Driftless Area. In January 2022, the federal district court held that federal approval of the project violated NEPA and the Refuge Act. Then, in July 2023, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the preliminary injunction and remanded the case for dismissal. In December 2023, the eastern half of the transmission line entered into service.

The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin issued a preliminary injunction suspending federal approvals for the land exchange in March 2024, but in May 2024, the Seventh Circuit reversed the order, holding that the district court had not made the required finding that the movants were “likely to succeed on the merits.” The U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service completed the land exchange in May 2024.
